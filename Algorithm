Turn Around Time : "Time difference between completion time and arrival time" (or)
                    "sum of waiting time and burst time".
                    
Waiting time : Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.  

#Algorithm

step 1 : create an array process[] and burst_time[]
step 2 : create an array burst_remaining_time[] . initially burst_reamaining_time[] = burst_time[]
step 3 : Initially t = 0 and array waiting_time[] = {0}
step 4 : keep traversing utill all process should be completed
         step 4.1 : IF burst_remaining_time[] > quntum then 
                        t = t + quntum
                        burst_remaining_time[] = burst_remaining_time - quntum
         step 4.2 : ELSE
                      t = t + burst_remaining_time[]
                      waiting_time[] = t - burst_time[]
                      burst_remaining_time[] = 0
                      
(Quntum <- which means cpu time)  
(Burst time <- It is time to complete a process)

Example :-

Quntum = 3   <-- CPU TIME
